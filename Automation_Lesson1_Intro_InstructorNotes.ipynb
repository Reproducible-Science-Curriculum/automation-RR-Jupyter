    "- Construct and compose function documentation that clearly defines inputs, output variables and behaviour.\n",

    "- Use Socrative quiz to collect answers from student activities (students can run their code in their notebooks, and post to socrative). This will allow the instructor to see what solutions students came up with, and identify any places where misconceptions and confusion are coming up. Using Socrative quizes also allows for a record of the student work to be analyzed after class to see how students are learning and where they are having troubles.\n",
    "- sharing of prepared Socrative Quizes designed to be used with the automation module can be shared by URL links to each teacher so they do not have to be remade."
