# automation-RR-Jupyter
Automation with Jupyter notebooks

[Google Notebook for brainstorming](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1umz_cpC5APu2GPXDPtczWMFlYNdDaht3CBgWNbm_XsI/edit#)


# General Flow of the lessons:
1. Create instructor notes
2. have a student notebook that is preformatted to follow the flow of the lesson for them to type and follow along with code themselves
3. have Socrative quizes to collect quick multiple choice responses, and some short answers - the answer from here can be saved and then analyzed over a period of time to see where common problems are coming up! - List links to Socrative quizes here and in notebooks.

# Notes: 
- automation_analysis_demo.ipynb is the draft notebook 'aka' final product we are trying to make in this workflow so build examples around this file
- We need to coordinate examples with previous modules. 
- We need to decide how interactive we want all this to be, is this valuable but not possible in the time given, therefore more valuable to do more demonstrations and walkthroughs? (most important for later lessons on functions) 
- What on your own lessons do we want links for?
- Do we want to include more on how to export figures? 

# Learning Objectives
### Lesson 1 (10-15min)
- Employ best practices of naming a variable including: don’t use existing function names, avoid periods in names, don’t use numbers at the beginning of a variable name.

### Lesson 2 (10-15min)
- Define DRY and provide examples of how you would implement DRY in your code; Don’t repeat yourself!
- Identify code that can be modularized following DRY and implement a modular workflow using functions.

### Lesson 3 (60 min)
- Know how to construct a function: variables, function name, syntax, documentation, return values
- Demonstrate use of function within the notebook / code. 
- Construct and compose function documentation that clearly defines inputs, output variables and behaviour.

### Lesson 4 (10-15min)
- Organize a set of functions within a python (.py) script and use it (import it into) in a Jupyter notebook.

### Lesson 5 (20-30min)
(optional lesson)
- Use asserts to test validity of function inputs and outputs

### Lesson 6 (To be added at a later time)
(right now this is not useful in people's current workflows in python)
- Demonstration of how to pull all components we went over together into one finished document
